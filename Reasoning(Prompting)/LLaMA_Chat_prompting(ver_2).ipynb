I keep secrets to protect myself and lies to put up a facade because I am tired of my life being used a weapon. I try to maintain a state of normality but wind up broken and beaten trying to catch my breath(literally catch my breath sometime *broken rib*). All I want ever is to be happy. This nightmare I live nearly cost me my job, my car, my life and more than once my sanity. And occumpanied with this chaotic river I call my life Ive been having odd nightmares. \n",

      "The nightmare I remember occuring most, I was on a hike with a few friends I remember their faces we will call them Linds, Mark, Colton, Chris, Jess, Kaydee, and Dom. Linds shes blonde tall blue eyes, Mark is short brown hair hazel eyes and a mustache(I commented on it several times in the nightmares), Colton average height short black hair white tshirt clean shave sharp powerful jaw line, Chris very short thin long dreads full beard always wears sunglasses, Jess tall curly hair round face huge smile, Kaydee average height skinny brunette with brown eyes, and Dom now he is a child short brown hair hyper active and very smart. So these nightmares always start out on a sunny day hiking in the mountains we are going along a very tight narrow trail with a wide tree spread as we are hiking along we make a detour to go to the summit of the peak and Dom runs ahead when he notices a glimmer in the distance I run after him happily. We stumble upon some shacks several of them about 3 or 4 with windows doors a fire pit all the soil looks freshly disturbed I warn dom as he runs into the huts you could say. They looked very unkempt with sticks and mud for walls branches and moss for roofs. And then this thing that looks like Gollum run out and hit Dom and charges me where I grab a stick and swing at him. At this point everyone else is coming up including Colton who is carrying a bundle of sticks so we can make camp. I instruct everyone to run while I charge the creature Dom stays why I do not know. Colton arms me with a large branch he collected that resembles a shillelagh (A tree root with a natural ball end) and I swing at the thing which is snarling at us. Kaydee and Mark are checking the huts for the off chance there maybe more of these things. I draw its attention to me while I stand infront of one of the huts on a slight hill my swing misses and all I see is this primal stare like that of a rabid dog snarling and trying to claw at me and bite me whilst I fight it off so the others can escape, Colton soon comes to the rescue clubbing it in the head knocking it off of me. We begin to tear the hut down by smashing the roof in Jess was helping move all our gear down the mountain to the creek that we came from. Chris helped us push it over onto him where I begin to burn the other huts. While he is pinned I gather myself shaking and afraid. And didnt notice the danger. We crossed bridges that were made with primitive materials we noticed damage to trees and marking not made by animals. Every night I suffer this nightmare and wake up to a spear being plunged through my chest. Its been like this and if anyone can help me I can supply more details about the nightmare. I dont want to sleep, I cant see that face again what it does and the people it kills in my nightmare. No matter what I do they always die and I die along with them.\n",

(no, that is not a typo...we started dating in 1994 and got engaged in 2000.)  anyway, for the better part of that time (guessing about 15 years or so) he's been an addict....his drug of choice is crack, but, of course, it didn't start that way.  he was a pothead when i met him, but that quickly led to coke and then crack.  his parents are alcoholics and so is he.  he's been arrested numerous times and is currently in jail now, with a court date tomorrow (driving w/o a license and possession of paraphernalia.)  i'm sick over his drug use and behavior. we live paycheck to paycheck and fight over money all the time.  his drug use takes precedence over everything else in his life, including me.  i am incredibly unhappy.....we started dating when we were 19 and we are 37 now....we have no home (live in his parents house with his dad), no kids (which i guess is a good thing, although, it is likely i will never be a mother and that hurts me), no assets, nothing.  i have a decent job that pays a decent wage,  but i bring home less than half of my annual salary as i had to take out a $25K loan against my 401(k) last year and am paying it back over the next 5 years through payroll deductions.  i am basically trying to cover all our bills/expenses on roughly $770, two times a month and it isn't working.  i love the guy, but am no longer in love with him.  he knows he has a problem, but refuses to do anything about it.  i thought about writing to that show, intervention, cause my insurance will only cover rehab for 30 days and he's been to a couple of 30 day facilities and it didn't help.....he needs long term rehab that we can't afford.  i want to leave him, but my entire family lives 2.5 hours away and i know that if i go to them, he will follow and harrass them.....my siblings have kids and i don't want them to be a part of my fiancee's craziness.  my mom is dead and my dad (step-dad) has health problems (namely a bad heart) and i don't want him to stress.  i don't have a relationship with my biological father and have no where to go if i do leave (needless to say, i also don't have the money to just pack up everything i own and disappear and i need my job and health insurance!!!)\n",

      "\n",
      "NLTK stands for \"Natural Language Toolkit\" and is a popular Python library used for natural language processing tasks such as text processing, tokenization, and text classification. In this tutorial, we will be using NLTK to perform text analysis and generate responses to user input.\n",

      "The text \"Started dating the guy I've had a crush on for a year! He's such a sweetheart and I can't wait to spend even more time with him.\" expresses the emotion of Happy.\n",

      "Here are the reasons why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Positive language: The text uses positive language, such as \"sweetheart,\" \"can't wait,\" and \"even more time.\" This suggests that the speaker is feeling a positive emotion, such as happiness.\n",
      "2. Excitement: The speaker is excited about the prospect of spending time with someone they have a crush on. This excitement is a common symptom of the happy emotion.\n",
      "3. Positive evaluation: The speaker evaluates the person they are interested in positively, using words like \"sweetheart.\" This suggests that they have a positive opinion of the person, which is a common feature of the happy emotion.\n",

      "Based on the text, here's an objective analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "The text appears to be a genuine expression of happiness and excitement about the new relationship. The use of words like \"freaking happy\", \"sweetheart\", and \"can't wait\" suggest a strong emotional response. The fact that the person has been together with the guy for a week and is already feeling this way indicates a strong emotional connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text also lacks any negative or anxious language, which is often present in texts labeled as \"Depression\" or \"Neutral\". The tone is overwhelmingly positive, which is consistent with the \"Happy\" label.\n",

I recently bought a web domain on a whim and started hosting it on the extremely old-school [FreeWebHostingArea](https://www.freewebhostingarea.com/) service, which essentially gives you nothing but a basic control panel with an FTP client to put your files online. That's more or less all I need (I think the site is about 1 MB total right now), but I'm not married to FWHA. I know for a fact that it'll start hosting weird porn ads on my site at some point (their default 404 page was littered with \\\"sexy singles in your area\\\" ads), and they already put an ugly sticker in the bottom right of all my pages.\\n\\nSo my question is: does anyone here know of a similar, extremely basic, preferably inexpensive web host? A lot of the ones tout streamlined drag-and-drop design or WordPress integration where, but I don't need or even want those features; I like writing all my HTML/CSS/Javascript by hand and just poking around until things function.\",\n          \"I have traveled quite a lot for the past year and much has changed but deep down, Im still primal with emotion. I changed 3 apartments due to harassment and abuse, I have not shared a intimate moment with anyone since my most recent move. I keep secrets to protect myself and lies to put up a facade because I am tired of my life being used a weapon. I try to maintain a state of normality but wind up broken and beaten trying to catch my breath(literally catch my breath sometime *broken rib*). All I want ever is to be happy. This nightmare I live nearly cost me my job, my car, my life and more than once my sanity. And occumpanied with this chaotic river I call my life Ive been having odd nightmares. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe nightmare I remember occuring most, I was on a hike with a few friends I remember their faces we will call them Linds, Mark, Colton, Chris, Jess, Kaydee, and Dom. Linds shes blonde tall blue eyes, Mark is short brown hair hazel eyes and a mustache(I commented on it several times in the nightmares), Colton average height short black hair white tshirt clean shave sharp powerful jaw line, Chris very short thin long dreads full beard always wears sunglasses, Jess tall curly hair round face huge smile, Kaydee average height skinny brunette with brown eyes, and Dom now he is a child short brown hair hyper active and very smart. So these nightmares always start out on a sunny day hiking in the mountains we are going along a very tight narrow trail with a wide tree spread as we are hiking along we make a detour to go to the summit of the peak and Dom runs ahead when he notices a glimmer in the distance I run after him happily. We stumble upon some shacks several of them about 3 or 4 with windows doors a fire pit all the soil looks freshly disturbed I warn dom as he runs into the huts you could say. They looked very unkempt with sticks and mud for walls branches and moss for roofs. And then this thing that looks like Gollum run out and hit Dom and charges me where I grab a stick and swing at him. At this point everyone else is coming up including Colton who is carrying a bundle of sticks so we can make camp. I instruct everyone to run while I charge the creature Dom stays why I do not know. Colton arms me with a large branch he collected that resembles a shillelagh (A tree root with a natural ball end) and I swing at the thing which is snarling at us. Kaydee and Mark are checking the huts for the off chance there maybe more of these things. I draw its attention to me while I stand infront of one of the huts on a slight hill my swing misses and all I see is this primal stare like that of a rabid dog snarling and trying to claw at me and bite me whilst I fight it off so the others can escape, Colton soon comes to the rescue clubbing it in the head knocking it off of me. We begin to tear the hut down by smashing the roof in Jess was helping move all our gear down the mountain to the creek that we came from. Chris helped us push it over onto him where I begin to burn the other huts. While he is pinned I gather myself shaking and afraid. And didnt notice the danger. We crossed bridges that were made with primitive materials we noticed damage to trees and marking not made by animals. Every night I suffer this nightmare and wake up to a spear being plunged through my chest. Its been like this and if anyone can help me I can supply more details about the nightmare. I dont want to sleep, I cant see that face again what it does and the people it kills in my nightmare. No matter what I do they always die and I die along with them.\",\n          \"I know this doesn't sound much. But he just makes me so freaking happy and today we've been together for a week.

In this tutorial, we will be creating a simple chatbot that can understand and respond to basic user input.\\n\\nNLTK stands for \\\"Natural Language Toolkit\\\" and is a popular Python library used for natural language processing tasks such as text processing, tokenization, and text classification. In this tutorial, we will be using NLTK to perform text analysis and generate responses to user input.\\n\\nBefore we begin, let's take a look at the tools and libraries we will be using:\\n\\n* Python 3.x\\n* NLTK library\\n* Jupyter Notebook\\n\\n02. Importing NLTK\\n--------------------\\n\\nTo use NLTK in our chatbot, we first need to import the library.
