"Reddit, could you help any of these 
people? I've asked this before, and the response was great, so I thought I'd do it again, a while back I set up something similar to /r/OffMyChest, the idea being that people would be able to post all of their problems anonymously and get help for the user community, sadly I'm a bit lacking in that area.

Could you go give a few people some helpful advice?

"I took the bike to school. I've been paying 50 bucks a month for daily bus rides to school, and today I decided it was enough. I have 5.7 km (3.6 miles) to school and I fucking did it. It took a little more than half an hour, and I did stop to throw up once, but I fucking managed to take the bike to school. And I'm sorry for cursing, but I'm just so damn pleased, and I wanted to share it somewhere.  

The sun is shining, I have a soda in my hand and I actually did something. I thought I was gonna burst into tears when I finally made it to school. 

I'm gonna go to math class and do absolutely nothing, now. And I'm also going to beat myself up over that. But at least I'll remember that I actually managed to go by bike for the first time in nearly a year. 

Thanks for reading, and sorry for taking up your time. 

EDIT: Thank you all very much for your nice comments and upvotes! They've elevated my spirits even higher than before. Also, thank you very much, who ever gave me gold for this. You all have inspired me to try and make this a habit. So thanks again, thank you thank you, thank you, for all your kindness. I'm very grateful I've been smiling more these two days than I've done for a very long time. This is feeling incredibly cheesy so I'm gonna end it here, but thanks again! ^ U ^",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,5.387037

This week was tough, work is hectic and I'm switching meds. Saturday night rolls around with no plans but I got a few texts from recently rediscovered friends. Just casual ""hellos"" and inside jokes but it was a good boost.

"An better day I'm always posting here when things are pretty bad, and I have gotten some very supportive advice.  I'd like to put something positive here just as a balance, and maybe it'll work for even just one other person. 

I've been feeling very lonely lately.  In a moment of positivity I signed up for a local meetup for this weekend.  I knew as I signed up, that when the time came, I'd talk myself out of going.  It's what I do.  I wrote myself notes while I was feeling good to push myself to go.  Low and behold, yes, when the time came I was terrified.  But I forced myself through the first awkward 10 minutes.  I think I may have even gone into autopilot to get through the initial terror.  But I went into a group of strangers by myself and stayed!  They were so welcoming I stayed for almost 3 hours!  I never thought I'd be able to do that alone.  I haven't been proud of myself in a while.  Today ended as a pretty good day.

And I have next weekend to look forward to.

"To all of you people here. Hi, I just wanted to say that you guys are all amazing.

I've suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, and it's been a struggle. There have been ups and downs, and painful times to be had. I've hated myself and even come close to dying because of this disease, and I realize this is likely the fact for you others as well (though hopefully not the almost dying part). 

I just wanted to say that you're all admirably strong and amazing to be able to make it day by day suffering from this awful problem, although I know it can be hard.

I wish everyone in the community a happy and amazing 2016, you guys all rock, no matter what anyone says. Cheers!",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,3.885995

"Progress! It actually feels great! *...and I should know, I haven't really ""felt"" anything since I was 8, I'm 22.* 


So at the influence of my loved ones who are all also mentally ill/on medication, I decided to seek therapy. After about 7 months of searching, I have finally found someone I like. He diagnosed me with severe Major Depression and a few anxiety disorders, most of which I expected honestly. 

I haven't officially begun treatment just yet, but a huge weight has been lifted. In the past, my solution has just been to get more drunk than I care to admit and try to sleep through eternity. But now that I know exactly what I'm experiencing, I've decided that I'm not completely hopeless and that I'm not as alone as I used to believe.  


Of course I'm excited for change, but I'm not posting to dangle my balls back and forth            *really slowly*
in anyone's face. I just imagine that there are a lot of people not being treated in this community, because I am exactly the same (until next week anyway). I've read a lot of posts here that sound like me at my worst and that's just awful. I highly encourage those of you not doing so already to seek help. If I'm not imagining things, change is on the horizon and its looking to be more beautiful than any California sunset will ever be. Good luck!      





P.S.

If anyone has had any sort of treatments/experiences that have worked to make this  disorder manageable, please share them. My therapist and I are going to determine what sort of solution will be the most effective and I would like to contribute some ideas if possible.",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,2.3658183
"I did it! I'm 21 and I have been depressed ever since I dropped out of college. Staying inside the house playing video games going to a small part time job. I traveled to Arizona to see an old friend and had a blast meeting new people out there and kind of get a since of there view of the world. It made me realize that even with my anxiety I can do anything. Just taking baby steps on casually talking to people helped a lot and just for once to not care what people think. Hell I even got laid out there. 

I wasn't excited about going back to college but I realized life is what you make it even if your depressed or have high anxiety. You just have to always have the fight and never give up. And only care how you view your as a person without anyone else's judgement.

"I got help. The therapist I recently went to offered a lot of good advice, listened to me, and made me laugh. 

He really doubts that what I'm going through is ""chemical"" depression; I eat well, go outside often, etc. He did note that it's possible, but my emotional issues are probably due to my current situation in school and my own self-driven anxiety.

"Day One of Therapy (again) I finally took the step I needed to take in helping myself feel better. Today I'm seeing a therapist for the first time (again) and going to try to really work on myself and my happiness. 

I've done this many times in the past, and mostly use therapy to vent because that's what helps me cope, but I've haven't stuck with it long term after high school (which ended 5 years ago). 

I finally decided to go back after a really dark and emotional night a few weeks back. I've never cared less about living than I have in the past few weeks. I've been depressed since I was 15, but I've really dug myself into a hole of self-hate the past month or so. I've never wanted to die, not consistently anyway, but I finally realized that if I want to live to see 24, I really should get some professional help. 

Thanks, /r/depression for listening. I hope that you also find the strength to pursue help and happiness. I know it's hard to confront everything, and it's gonna be a tough road for me too, but I know if I can do it, you can too.",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,1.6770402
"I've had my job for about 2 months and I'm getting unhappier with it every day. What should I do? I'm a web developer (PHP) at a semi-large company in Canada. I started as a contract job working on one of their client's sites but after about 2 weeks of me working there, they offered me full time. The company is mostly full of account managers with only about 4 of us doing the actual developer work. Literally 15:4 ratio. They of course make more money than all of us who actually code the sites.

Some of our major clients websites (that were made before I was there) are poorly coded and obviously rushed to meet deadlines. They all feel like they are patched on patches to fix this patch. A pile of bandaids if you will. Really confusing to work with pretty much all the time.

Us developers got an email the other day from our boss saying how disappointed he was in us for being slow with our work and making a lot of mistakes (mistakes as in ""this takes 2mins to fix"" mistakes, not losing client mistakes), and for generally being lazy. None of us believe we were THAT terrible at all, especially since we've stayed late (no overtime pay by the way) multiple times and some of us stayed overnight to do projects to fit their deadlines. Our boss just went on about how we're doing poorly and swore multiple times in the email in a REALLY unprofessional way.

I'm just generally stressed out and unhappy working there (as are the other developers) and I really can't take much more, and after that email I'm completely checked out and just don't care anymore. The pay is good and I like doing this kind of work, it's just the attitude from the company/boss that really gets to me.

I'm also moving soon, so having money right now is kind of a big deal. Best case scenario is I quit when I find another place, but I don't know if I can last that long without getting completely depressed.

What should I do reddit?",Depression_Group,Happy_Group,1.667134
"Feeling at peace with my childhood I never got the love or attention I've craved as a child. I taught myself to bottle up my feelings. I dealt with death without letting out a single tear. It all caught up with me of course, there's a very sad little girl inside of me trying to get out. However I'm finally coming to understand the feelings of uncontrollable sadness and anger I get now I'm older.

What should i do in such a position? I am currently working for a start-up company and I believe I work hard (at least as hard as a fresher can). My boss who also happens to be a close relative which I am grateful for the job he has provided. He asks me to do daily tasks which of course I do and succeed at some and fail at some. The problem is even in spite of doing the tasks he still complains that I don't dedicate everything to my work and tells me that I work half-hearted. Sometimes he gets even crazier such that even after I do the task he scolds me for not doing it correctly. I seriously don’t understand why...What should I do?

"Thank goodness, I'm doing ok now. (This is a copy/paste+slight edit from a comment I made on an /r/AskReddit thread, but I felt like my story may be of interest to people here.)

I'm doing ok now, thank goodness. I have a job as a translator for a video game linguistics company, where everyone is super nice, the work is challenging but enjoyable, and I get to play video games that haven't come out yet and I'm not allowed to talk about. I'm back with my parents' house now, but they're both amazing human beings and I am so glad to have them in my life. My social life could be better, but people at work are nice to chat to, so I'm not complaining.

Its kind of weird to think that less than half a year ago I was suffering from such crippling depression that I literally didn't get out of my bed for days - if not weeks - on end, my room had dozens of flies in it from all the rotten food, I barely ever washed, I was malnourished and was regularly light headed from thirst and hunger, I was dreading the day when my utter failure at university would come out in the open. And somehow, worst of all was the fact that amongst all my colleagues, I should have had the easiest time; for me, my degree should have been a breeze in the park, yet I succumbed to a destructive spiral of total apathy and contrasting anxiety and failed my degree, while my fellow students succeeded with hard work and dedication I simply couldn't - or didn't - give. I felt like such a failure, because, well, I was.

I couldn't imagine being this ok with my life back then. Turns out I didn't even need the degree to get a job in its related field anyway; my pre-existing knowledge about the subject (Japanese Language, btw, and I'm half-Japanese/bilingual, hence why it should have been easy) was enough to get me the job, and now the job experience is more valuable.

Even better, once my contract ends in December (I'm optimistic that the contacts I've made will mean getting another contract in the future will be easier), I'm going to - and I'm not joking here - join a semester course to a circus school. Circus skills has been a passion of mine for (on-and-off) 15 years, so 'Running away to the circus' as cliche'd as that saying is, is something I've wanted to do for a very long time. But I kinda feel like I've matured as an adult enough to the point where I could viably pursue it. A single semester also means it isn't too long if I find difficulty with it as well. I really really hope it'll be amazing though - almost everything about circus skills has been amazing so far, after all.

I imagine there are quite a lot of people here that are themselves in a shitty place similar, or worse, to what used to be mine, right now... That really really sucks, and I'm so sorry you're there right now. Nobody deserves that. That might be hard to believe for some of you (I know I felt like I deserved what I got when I was depressed), but trust me: *you don't deserve to be depressed.*

I'm sharing how I got out in hopes that it may help some of you here. The way I got out of that dark time was thanks to 2 factors: taking little steps, and being forced into a corner. (Side note: sadly for me, medical help didn't really help me. I genuinely feel that the National Health Service failed me. *But that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek medical help, if you are capable of doing so.* I tried, it didn't help, but it *can* help for some people.)

The first one is advice for all elements of life. If you can't handle something, break it down into smaller and smaller steps until you find a step you're willing to take. For me, I broke it down all the way to trying to get out of my room and take a shower; the cleanliness of hot water was my first step. Yours may need to be a bigger step, or a smaller step.

Sometimes though, depression means that any step, no matter how small, isn't enough. I know it was for me, which was why I was stuck for such a long time. Just... *nothing* was easier than any small a step. I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't shower, couldn't nothing. Which was why the second factor was so important.

The second one isn't so great. Basically, my father was coming to my city for work-related stuff and wanted to see me. It was something I simply couldn't avoid; he knew where I lived, and my parents kinda knew something might be wrong by the fact I wasn't replying to their attempts at contact. My destructive life style was made possible by the fact that nobody knew how bad I was at: ordering takeaways online meant I didn't have to leave the house for food; my laptop and internet meant I could keep myself distracted from my own reality. But I couldn't avoid my parents any longer, as they would be literally knocking on my doorstep. I couldn't let them see me in that state; I had to get out of bed and get myself together, not completely, but at least to the point where I could tell them I needed help. 

I hope you don't get to the point where you're forced to act like this. Recovering from sheer shame kinda sucks. But it is an option. Simply waiting till you can't wait no longer, while not optimal, is certainly how I got out. Again, if you can avoid this step, goddammit avoid it. But for me at least, life forced me out of my horrible but comfortable rut, so maybe it can work for others too.

Goodluck, and I hope you can find yourself where I am now. Believe it or not, *you can do this.*",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,1.3767737
"Dressed up for the first time in a long time. It's been years since I last did anything at all for Halloween. I think I stopped caring about it when I first made my transition into 'teenhood', thinking it was pointless. It was only a week before Halloween when I thought of dressing up and the idea came about during a pretty bad slump. I just wanted to do something different or opposed to my usual character. Maybe donning a different outfit for a day would change something you know?",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,1.263042
"First holiday without family I moved to a new town for work about 6 hours drive away from where my parents and brother live and 10 hours from where my sister and her fiance live. 

I was home with everyone for Thanksgiving and ended up getting into some intense conversations with my father. I work with refugee populations in the US and my work has been extremely time consuming and difficult due to the current administration. Both of my parents voted for the candidate who is making my life and the life of the clients I work with so much more difficult. 

I try not to bring things up when I am with my parents, but my dad tends to get into this awful alpha male patriarchy thing whenever the whole family is around. He brought it up when he was already a few drinks in and slurring his words, and I used knowledge from the field I work in and experience as a woman to defend my beliefs. Long story short, he said he didn't care about any of that and we haven't had a real conversation since. 

My older brother and sister are much more similar to me and my sister works with similar populations as I do.

Knowing I wouldn't be able to take time off for the holidays, I invited my family to come visit me and see the new town I am living in. My sister and her fiance already had plans to go to see his family and my parents didn't want to because they don't want to make the drive. 

My brother, who is 6 years older than me and has been struggling with addiction since I was in early high school, said he would come up and spend the holiday with me. 

He knows I struggle with anxiety/depression and he himself has struggled with these same illnesses. I spoke to him on the phone the other day and told him how I was loving my new town and roommates but I was really excited to see him for the holidays. He called me out on sounding depressed and I broke down crying on the phone. Everything here is going so well but I can't seem to get my head to accept this and be happy. 

Today, he told me he would actually be driving to canada to see a woman he met on a dating app 3 weeks ago and spend Christmas with her and her two children. He said he would stop by on his way back home for an hour or two (I'm on the way for him) but minutes later recinded this offer saying thinking about that much driving made him sick. This is coming from the person who has driven 6 hours for a single night to see a concert and is already driving 8+ hours out of his way to spend Christmas with people he doesn't even know. 

I know this is his addict and impulsive personality showing through but in all the years of making sure my big brother was alright, I never learned how to properly handle the huge disappointments he has hurled my way. Since I was really young, I was the one person in my family he would talk to and listen to, and my parents often made me talk him down from his suicide threats and try to guilt him out of doing drugs and getting in fights and trouble with the police. I could really benefit from him supporting me for once. 

I don't have many people I feel like I can talk to about this in general, let alone in this new town I'm living in, and I'm really depressed about spending the holidays alone. Luckily one of my roommates is leaving their dog here for me to look after so she should keep me sane.

"Good movies and TV shows Hey everyone, long story short, over the past three months I've had terrible depression and anxiety due to a really awful idea to take mdma. I'm almost through my third week of Fluoxetine/Prozac and I can't believe I may have another week to three weeks to go!

This will be a long weekend and before this happened I may have wanted to plan a trip or go hiking, but I will probably be afraid to leave my apartment for most of the weekend. Any recommendations for good movies and TV shows to pass the time? Ideally because of how I've been feeling (and dealing with derealization/depersonalization as well), light, upbeat movies would be best.

Thanks! I hope you all have an okay day and weekend.",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,1.1943488
"Guys, I'm better I'm happy again.

I was so worried because my girlfriend was going away, and it would be a long distance relationship deal. I was stressing over not seeing her anymore. I cried myself to sleep every night, cried at least an hour during the day, and was not happy.


Then we broke up.




All of the stress related to her has been lifted. I don't need to worry anymore. After reading yall's thoughts for the duration of this, I figured you should hear how I got better.



I don't feel totally qualified to give advice, but what I think would help some of you is


&gt;find the source of your stress


&gt;try and remove it from your life. It'll seem hard, but it helped me immensely.



If I could give one subreddit that has helped me more than I could have imagined, it's /r/howtonotgiveafuck.


It has helped me get away from worrying about others' opinions of me. They don't matter anyway.


If you don't feel this belongs in this sub, go ahead and down vote it. I get it. I'm not one of you anymore. I can remember how you feel. I was there. Its time to unsub now.",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,1.1369984
"Reflecting I typically do not reminisce, but today (for the first time since my recovery) I allowed myself to truly assess my progress. My depression reached its peak during my freshmen-sophomore years of high school where I had severe anxiety and severe depression/suicidal thoughts provoked by very unfortunate circumstances in my life. The years leading up to that I only had severe anxiety and minor depression.

I spent most of my time planning and imaging my suicide. I was consumed by it. I never did any school work because I never even considered the fact that I might still be alive for high school graduation.

I graduated in June and I will be going into my first year of college in five weeks. I am no longer depressed. I have not had a single suicidal thought in about 9 months. For the fist time in my life, I am looking forward to my future.

"People think my waking up at 4:00 AM and exercising is a positive thing. In reality I do it because I've been lying awake for hours feeling such disgust and fear and self loathing that I simply can't take it anymore. 

I suppose it's more positive than shooting myself, but that's hardly an overall positive.",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,0.9434317
"i’m really tired one of my coping mechanisms is acting happy. if i pretend to be happy, i trick myself into thinking i’m genuinely happy. but then there’s time’s like this where acting gets really exhausting and i face the reality that i’m a sad nobody who will achieve nothing, no matter how hard i try or pretend that things are okay",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,0.85105175
"2014 was the shittiest year of my life. But you helped. I have chronic bipolar depression and usually it comes and goes, but 2014 was the year that it stayed from January until December. I'm finally doing better, thank god, but this year involved a suicide attempt, neverending sicknesses, isolation, hard drugs, unprotected sex and a whole plethora of awful and unhealthy lifestyle choices. I am so happy I'm doing better now and I am thrilled that I made it to 2015. I am never attempting suicide again; that event sort of broke me down to hopefully make me better. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I am hopeful for 2015. I want to live for myself; I want to be healthy and I just want to be at peace. I know now that I will never attempt suicide again because I talked to my parents a week after and I was so ashamed and horrified at what I had become...no matter how bad it gets, I'm going to try to truck through. I just wanted to take the time to thank you all at r/depression for hearing me vent, letting me talk, and letting me feel safe. You guys mean more than you know, and I love that you have no judgement. Thank you for helping me recover and best wishes and love to you. ",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,0.7752244
"The other day I found out that this really great girl I've been seeing for a while has been leading me on for over a month... So yea, I found that out the other day when I heard from some people that she was seen with another guy to a party over the weekend. Come to find out, the guy is a close friend of mine and they fucked in his car after the party... I bought her a really nice Christmas gift that I know will mean a lot to her but now I don't really know if giving it to her is a great idea. She collects vinyl records so I got her this really nice original mint condition black sabbath album for Christmas. After hearing about what happened though neither her or my friend have said much to me the past few days... I feel cheated and lied too because apparently this wasn't just a one time thing. Deep down I think I always knew that it would never work out. She's from a really well off family, and has always had everything her heart desires, and I'm just a poor boy. My parrents have always struggled to make ends meet... Until recently I lived in a small one story house on a dirt road, I never really had much and so I'm pretty easy to please... It's true what they say you know, rich girls don't date poor boys. But I know that she's used to that kind of lifestyle so I spoiled her, I wanted her to know I wasn't like my parrents... Sad broke and alone... From the moment we started hanging out together my life changed in so many ways... I was happier, more confident, I smiled more, I talked to people more almost two months ago I thought things had started to get somewhat serrious when she kissed me one night when I took her home, after that we began going steady somewhat but still without a title. I took her on dates, we went to concerts we had made out a few times, but I thought she just really wanted to take it slow... After hearing about what's been going on behind my back though that perfect bubble I'd been living I. Finally popped. My world came crashing down and now I don't really care much for anything that used to make me happy... I don't like the same songs because they remind me of her, I don't like the same foods, I don't go to the same places... All I wanna do is get shit facedand get stoned in my closet, I've been an emotional wreck on the inside all finals week so far and I just don't really know how much more school I can take right now. I'm confused and hurt and sad and angry at myself all at the same time. Most days I wake up to look in the mirror and I hate myself. I try and I try to pick out something, anything about myself that I like, and I just can't think of anything. I hate my eyes, my smile, I'm too short, I wish I had harder abs or atleast a flatter stomach, my hands and feet are oddly small of a guy, I'm too short, I hate my hair, my complexion is ok maybe 3-4 out of every 10 days or so... I just I've realized that I just wasn't good enough for her... That's my place in the universe now I guess. None of us get to choose the lives were born into, I never wanted this. I just wish I couldn't feel at all sometimes maybe then I'd be at peace. Maybe then I wouldn't feel so bad about where I'm at right now. All I know is I fell in love, real love... True love with someone I wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life with, and because I was so stupid... I opened up and gave her my heart let her know just how much she meant to me, now, I lost her... ",Depression_Group,Neutral_Group,0.7574069
"tried to self harm for the first time the knife i used was too blunt and by the time i had worked up the courage to use a sharp razor blade someone knocked the door and my family came downstairs

i thought i was getting better

update: i cut my arm with the razor blade in my bathroom. 

2: always thought about doing it, tonight i just felt really sad and decided to do it. i cut my arm, not very much though, I did want to cut more but worried about getting caught

it felt strangely relieving
