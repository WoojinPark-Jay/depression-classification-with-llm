"I am a housewife in my 20s. Through early marriage and childbirth, I have built a happy home and welcomed an irreplaceable, adorable baby. However, at times, I feel despair due to the halt in my career development. While staying at home every day to prepare meals for the children, do laundry, and take care of my husband is certainly worthwhile, there are moments when I also feel the desire to pursue my own career. Sometimes, I feel envious when I see my friends' careers, and I worry that my husband might one day feel useless. While it is joyful to see the baby and participate in their growth process, sometimes watching the baby due to anxiety doesn't feel enjoyable. Sometimes, even when the baby is playful, I can't smile.",Depression,Happy,0.9039905071258545,"[0.09373518079519272, 0.002274321625009179, 0.9039905071258545]"
"Despite my successful career and the admiration of my colleagues, my personal life feels like it's crumbling around me. The recent fight with my husband and his decision to file for divorce has left me feeling like a failure, like I've lost control of the one aspect of my life that truly matters. While I excel at work and am seen as a role model, I can't shake the feeling of inadequacy and despair in my personal relationships. It's a stark contrast to the confidence and competence I exhibit in my professional life, and it's challenging to reconcile these conflicting emotions.

"Despite my professional success and recognition at work, I often feel overlooked and unappreciated at home. While my colleagues and juniors admire my achievements and seek to learn from me, within the walls of my own home, I sometimes feel like a mere provider rather than the respected head of the household. It's disheartening to sense that my children only approach me when they need something, rather than seeking my guidance or simply wanting to spend time together. Communication with my wife has dwindled over the years, and I long for the deep connection we once shared. Despite these feelings of loneliness and disconnection, the surprise birthday party my family threw for me last year moved me to tears and reminded me of the love that still exists within our family. It sparked a desire within me to prioritize spending more quality time with my loved ones and to work on strengthening our relationships.

"As a teenager with a passion for music and dreams of majoring in cello, I find myself torn between my aspirations and my relationship with my girlfriend. While I deeply appreciate her kindness and thoughtfulness, especially when she surprises me with homemade lunch boxes for our picnics, her occasional lack of support for my musical ambitions leaves me feeling conflicted. I cherish the loving moments we share, but I can't help but question whether it's healthy to pursue a deeper relationship when we don't see eye-to-eye on something as fundamental as my future career path. There's a part of me that longs for a partner who fully embraces and supports my dreams, yet I also recognize the value of her kindness and companionship. It's a complex mix of emotions, and I find myself grappling with the uncertainty of whether to prioritize my personal aspirations or the relationship itself.
