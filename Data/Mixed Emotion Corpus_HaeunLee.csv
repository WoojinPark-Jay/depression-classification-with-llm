We rode all the rides, played games, and even had ice cream! Dad bought me a big balloon, and we laughed a lot. I felt really happy being with Dad. Even though Mom and Dad don't live together anymore, I'm glad we can still have fun times like this. Dad promised we'll do it again soon, and I can't wait! Today was one of the best days ever!"
Happy-like,"Recently, it has become difficult to make a living at a part-time job at a supermarket due to low wages and delayed salaries. Working every day was becoming increasingly tiring and motivation was disappearing. But a recent meeting at church changed that. I met an acquaintance by chance, heard about my situation, supported me, and helped me receive a scholarship. The generosity and kindness I experienced lifted my spirits and filled me with gratitude. With this new financial support, I feel relieved and hopeful for the future. Despite the challenges, I was reminded of the power of community and the importance of asking for help when you need it."

Despite the difficulties, I find strength in knowing that I am doing everything I can to provide for my family and give them the best possible life. The support of my community and the small victories along the way remind me that I am not alone in this journey. Ultimately, the bond I share with my children brings me immense joy and fulfillment, making every sacrifice worthwhile."
