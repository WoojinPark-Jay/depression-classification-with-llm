At school, I thrive as the student council president, respected by my peers and professors for my leadership and academic achievements. Yet, the moment I return home, I'm plunged into an atmosphere of discord and discomfort. Despite my parents' pride in my good grades, our conflicting values lead to constant tension, especially during family dinners, which become a battleground of silent disagreement. While I maintain a facade of harmony with my brothers, the underlying awkwardness reflects the deeper divide within our family. My parents' praise for my academic success is overshadowed by their criticism of my extracurricular commitments, which I firmly believe are crucial for my future career. Even though I am accepted by my family, I often find myself withdrawing into silence, yearning for the understanding and validation I receive at school. The stark realization that life at school feels more fulfilling than life at home fills me with confusion and sadness, leaving me questioning where I truly belong."

It's getting harder to control my stress, and sometimes I feel like I just want to lash out and hit something. Coming home to the warm hugs and understanding of my parents and siblings brings a sense of emotional stability, but as I lay in bed, the thought of facing another day of work tomorrow fills me with despair.

But as the days blur into an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning, and tending to my family, I often feel like I've lost myself. My career, once full of potential, has come to a standstill, and I can’t help but wonder if I’ll ever regain what I gave up.

Every morning, I wake up to the same routine, yet a hollow emptiness lingers. I watch my friends thrive in their careers, their lives filled with ambition and progress, while I remain stuck in place, unseen and unacknowledged. Envy gnaws at me, and I question whether I made the right choices.

Even moments that should bring joy—seeing my baby smile, holding them close—are sometimes tainted by an overwhelming weight of exhaustion and anxiety. I should feel grateful, but instead, I feel trapped. Some days, I catch myself staring at the walls, unable to find the energy to engage. Even when my baby laughs, my face remains blank, as if the ability to feel happiness has slipped away from me.

At times, I wonder if my husband will one day see me the way I fear I’ve become—useless, stagnant, a mere shadow of who I once was. I tell myself that what I do is meaningful, that my sacrifices matter, but deep down, I can't shake the thought that I am disappearing, fading into a role that consumes me entirely."

As I contemplate separation, I'm grappling with the realization that success in one area doesn't guarantee happiness or fulfillment in another."

Depression,"My life was perfectly calm and peaceful. The sudden illness of my mother has thrown me into emotional turmoil, shattering the sense of security and harmony I once felt at home. My nerves are frayed, and I find myself unable to control my emotions, even lashing out at my sister in a recent fight. The embarrassment I feel about my current state stems from the stark contrast to the peaceful family life I've always known. I compounded by the fact that I haven't had confront such challenges like my parent's death.

It's like walking on eggshells, never knowing when the next argument will erupt. Sometimes I feel suffocated, trapped in this cycle of conflict and uncertainty. Other times, I just feel numb, like I've shut down to protect myself from the chaos around me. Despite the turmoil, there are moments of warmth and connection that remind me of the love that still exists within my family. But those moments are fleeting, overshadowed by the constant bickering and discord. I wish I could escape, find some peace and stability outside of this tumultuous environment.

Every day feels like a struggle, with a constant sense of emptiness and sadness gnawing at my insides. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in, watching everyone else connect and bond while I remain on the sidelines, unable to bridge the gap between us.

And the more I withdraw into myself, the harder it becomes to reach out and connect with others, perpetuating this vicious cycle of loneliness and despair.

Despite the love and support from my family, the stress and emotional turmoil of my job have taken a toll on my mental health, leaving me feeling overwhelmed and hopeless.

I long to break free from this cycle of abuse and dependency, but the fear of the unknown and the lack of experience in navigating life without my parents' control leaves me feeling paralyzed and trapped. It's a constant battle between the desire for liberation and the fear of stepping into the unknown abyss of independence. I want to overcome this whole situation and move on to a better future, but I don't know how to do it."
Depression,"Today, once again, as I walk the streets, the familiar stares and suspicious glances follow me. I don't know what to do, how to overcome this. Why must I always endure this pain? Why do I appear so weak? It's so hard to bear this discrimination. I just want to find a place where my existence is accepted. But it feels like I'll always be ignored. No matter what I do, nothing changes. Is there a sudden odor coming from my body? Do I smell like onions, as racists say? It pains me to think about it.

Dodging my father's drinking bottle and tiptoeing around the house to avoid waking them up has become a daily routine filled with dread. It's hard to imagine a future free from this pain and turmoil when the very people who are supposed to protect and nurture me are the source of my suffering. The brief moments of relief I find at school or with friends are just fleeting distractions from the harsh reality awaiting me at home. Sometimes, I can't help but wish I had different parents, ones who weren't consumed by addiction. But deep down, I know that this is my reality, and it's a harsh truth I have to learn to live with. The thought of suggesting treatment for my parents fills me with fear, knowing the potential consequences. It's a heavy burden to carry, and I often feel powerless to change my circumstances."

However, behind closed doors, her behavior took a dark turn. Her unpredictable mood swings and violent outbursts left me and my siblings living in constant fear. I tried to protect my younger brother by hiding with him, but it felt like there was no escape from her rage.
