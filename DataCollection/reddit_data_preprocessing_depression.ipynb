       "'We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \\n\\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.'"
